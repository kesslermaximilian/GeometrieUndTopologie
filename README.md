# Geometrie und Topologie

These are my lecture notes for the 'Einf√ºhrung in die Geometrie und Topologie', taught by [Daniel Kasprowski](http://www.math.uni-bonn.de/people/daniel/) in the summer term 2021 at the University of Bonn. There is no guarantee for completeness or correctness.

- The homepage of the course can also be found [here](http://www.math.uni-bonn.de/people/daniel/2021/geotopo/)
- The [most recent version](kesslermaximilian.github.io/GeometrieUndTopologie/full.pdf) of this script is made available with [Travis CI](https://github.com/traviscibot). You can also have a look at the [generated log files](kesslermaximilian.github.io/GeometrieUndTopologie/full.log)

## Set-up
This document uses custom packages, so you you won't be directly able to compile this document. They are available as my [Latex Packages](https://github.com/kesslermaximilian/LatexPackages) repository and added as a submodule to this repository. You will have to clone them as well and tell TeX where to find these before compiling. Follow these steps:

### Clone the repository
I recommend to directly clone the repository with the submodules, this can be done via   
```git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/kesslermaximilian/GeometrieUndTopologie.git```   
Alternatively, you can clone this repository as usual (or if you have done so already and are now struggling with compiling) and then have to obtain the submodule directly via   
``` git submodule update --init --merge --recurse ```   
This will then clone the submodule into the corresponding folder. This command will also be initiated by an easy `make init`

#### SSH issues
If you are usually accessing git using `ssh`, it is possible that you have trouble cloning the submodule, as this is added over `https`. You will have to clone the usual repository first and then edit the `.submodules` file `git` provides and change the url of the submodule to the `ssh` version manually. Then run `gut submodule update` with above arguments. This should clone the submodule via `ssh` now.

### Tell TeX  where to find the packages
By default, TeX will try to search for packages in your source folder, your tex installation folder (e.g. TeXLive) or your custom TeX folder (typically `~/texmf/tex/latex`).
- We use the `TEXINPUTS` environment variable to achieve this, so before compiling just enter   
```export TEXINPUTS=LatexPackages//:`   
in your shell.
- TeX will now look in this directory (relative to the source file) for packages and properly find the custom packages. Note that this only holds for the current shell, you will have to enter this for each new shell you start.
- To simplify, there is a shell script `export_texinputs.sh` that will execute exactly this. To call it, use `source ./export_texinputs.sh` so that the export command is executed in your current shell and not in a newly-created subshell

### Compile with make
To simplify the compilation process even further, there is a `Makefile` that will automatically export the corresponding path correctly and then compile the document properly. This uses `latexmk`. Run
- `make master` to only compile the (smaller) master version.
- `make full` or just `make` to compile the full document.

## Document structure

### File Structure
The main ```.tex``` Files are ```master.tex``` and ```Topologie.tex```. They both include 
- The file ```preamble.tex``` which is shared among all courses
- The short ```abstract.tex```
- All the ```lec_01.tex`` files (which include the lectures)
- The exercises at the back of the document, which are found in the ```exercises``` subfolder

### Why two files?
- I use the ```master.tex``` file for writing up the lecture, here several things are excluded, usually only 2 lectures are compiled and notes are also shown.
  This is to improve compiling speed, as i often save + compile the file while writing it
- Contrarily, in ```Topology.tex``` 'everything' is included, which means proper Bibliography, Indexing, Table of Contents and Appendices. Notes are not compiled to not disturb.

### Figures
I use a combination of 
- hand-drawn figures, if i did not have time to make a proper one yet (or no motivation)
- inkscape figures in ```.pdf_tex``` format, the source files are in the ```figures``` directory
- external figures copied from elsewhere, also found in ```figurse```. You can find the source in the document in this case
- TikZ figures
- Plots with ```gnuplot``` (supported by TikZ). Note that to use ```gnuplot``` you usually have to install it on your system, but if the ```Topology.gnuplots``` directory is present yet, TikZ can automatically read in the table generated by gnuplot, so you don't have to install it. Just don't remove these (auxiliary) files, and you'll be fine compiling on your own. More details can be found in the TikZ manual

## Options
There are several (custom) compiling options:
- ```lecturenumbers``` (default): Numbers the environments like in the lecture
- ```truenumbers```: (overwrites lecturenumbers) Numbers like one would 'usually' do it, i.e. every Theorem etc. is numbered
- ```numberall```: (overwrites lecturenumbers) Number remarks etc. as well
- ```nostars```: Don't show stars at custom environments (makes them fit more into the document), by default this is turned off (so stars are shown)
- ```nodaggers```: Don't show the daggers at edited environments, also turned off by default
- ```excludestars```: Don't show the self-added environments. If you don't like my comments, use this option when compiling
- ```excludeoral```: Exclude the oral remarks from the document (by default, thye are shown).

To use these, just add them (separated by comma) in the first line of ```Topologie.tex``` into the options of the document class.
