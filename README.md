# Geometrie und Topologie

These are my lecture notes for the 'Einf√ºhrung in die Geometrie und Topologie', taught by [Daniel Kasprowski](http://www.math.uni-bonn.de/people/daniel/) in the summer term 2021 at the University of Bonn. There is no guarantee for completeness or correctness.

- The most recent (compiled) version of the script can be found at TODO

## Set-up
This document uses custom packages, so you you won't be directly able to compile this document. They are available as my [Latex Packages](https://github.com/kesslermaximilian/LatexPackages) repository and added as a submodule to this repository. You will have to clone them as well and tell TeX where to find these before compiling. Follow these steps:

### Clone the repository
I recommend to directly clone the repository with the submodules, this can be done via
```git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/kesslermaximilian/GeometrieUndTopologie.git```

## File Structure
The main ```.tex``` Files are ```master.tex``` and ```Topologie.tex```. They both include 
- The file ```preamble.tex``` which is shared among all courses
- The short ```abstract.tex```
- All the ```lec_01.tex`` files (which include the lectures)
- The exercises at the back of the document, which are found in the ```exercises``` subfolder

## Why two files?
- I use the ```master.tex``` file for writing up the lecture, here several things are excluded, usually only 2 lectures are compiled and notes are also shown.
  This is to improve compiling speed, as i often save + compile the file while writing it
- Contrarily, in ```Topology.tex``` 'everything' is included, which means proper Bibliography, Indexing, Table of Contents and Appendices. Notes are not compiled to not disturb.

## Figures
I use a combination of 
- hand-drawn figures, if i did not have time to make a proper one yet (or no motivation)
- inkscape figures in ```.pdf_tex``` format, the source files are in the ```figures``` directory
- external figures copied from elsewhere, also found in ```figurse```. You can find the source in the document in this case
- TikZ figures
- Plots with ```gnuplot``` (supported by TikZ). Note that to use ```gnuplot``` you usually have to install it on your system, but if the ```Topology.gnuplots``` directory is present yet, TikZ can automatically read in the table generated by gnuplot, so you don't have to install it. Just don't remove these (auxiliary) files, and you'll be fine compiling on your own. More details can be found in the TikZ manual

## Options
There are several (custom) compiling options:
- ```lecturenumbers``` (default): Numbers the environments like in the lecture
- ```truenumbers```: (overwrites lecturenumbers) Numbers like one would 'usually' do it, i.e. every Theorem etc. is numbered
- ```numberall```: (overwrites lecturenumbers) Number remarks etc. as well
- ```nostars```: Don't show stars at custom environments (makes them fit more into the document), by default this is turned off (so stars are shown)
- ```nodaggers```: Don't show the daggers at edited environments, also turned off by default
- ```excludestars```: Don't show the self-added environments. If you don't like my comments, use this option when compiling
- ```excludeoral```: Exclude the oral remarks from the document (by default, thye are shown).

To use these, just add them (separated by comma) in the first line of ```Topologie.tex``` into the options of the document class.
