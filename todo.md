- lecture 6: fix `\iflecturenumbers` correctly, not just with ugly `\csname` hack
- lecture 8: use `gag` environment again for fractional environment number
- saving / restoring of counters after returning to lecture ... ?
- rework ugly preamble stuff into own package

- idea: create even one more package that collects all the other ones, to use this in the full and master file ...?
